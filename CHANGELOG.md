## [1.1.1] - 2021-08-03

### Added
  
### Changed
-	The `composer.json` file according to new version
-	Changed the use of `sizeof()` to `count()` in `controller/admin_controller.php` and `controller/main_controller.php`
-	Prefixed all languge variables in `language/ISO/common.php`, `language/ISO/exceptions.php` and corresponding template and PHP files with `KB_`
	(with the exception of 'APPROVED', 'DENIED' and 'DISAPPROVED' since this variables serve as keys into an array and prefixing them destroys the array

	PHP files
